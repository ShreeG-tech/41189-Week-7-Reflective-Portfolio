# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio
## Week 7
### What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt about the 3 types of emergent behaviour: Peer Effects and Social Contagion, Coordination and Culture, and Social Learning. The models accompanying these emergent behaviours are Schelling’s Segregation Model, Granovetter’s Riot Model and the Standing Ovation Model-which show things spread. Then there is Axelrod’s culture model and pure coordination games that portray cultures and how we coordinate. Lastly, there is the Replicator Dynamics model, falling under Social Learning.

### What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week’s learning’s taught me a lot about the 6 new models-that all explain how things spread, how we coordinate, how culture arises, and how we learn. The Segregation model, informs us that micro motives do not lead to macro behaviour, even though we might think otherwise in the outside world-when people claim that little things lead to big things, not apparently so when it comes to one’s behaviour. Yes, children are naughty when they’re young, but then they become mature adults, and hopefully outgrow their bad behaviour as they grow up and change, as they experience different viewpoints and people at that. 

Riot models showcase how variance drives behaviour.  The Standing ovation model, displays the spreading of information/ideas from centralised sources- a hall or theatre is a centralised location, packed with all sorts of people viewing a performance, and they will of course have their own opinions on it, most of them will clap when the show is over. Pure coordination, tells us the differences across peoples of different races, ethnicities, and regions. Axelrod’s model portrays how culture is often repetitive and has consistent coordination. The Replicator dynamics model shows the rate of adaptation proportional to variation. The universal truth that these models all have in common is that they all seek to drive the point home that not everyone is the same. We are all influenced by internal and external factors.

Schelling studied the following statement that many say is a great contemporary issue: There is widespread racial and income segregation in most parts of the developed world. Of course, one could say that people are fundamentally racist, so there wouldn’t be any need for a model. To test alternative hypotheses, this is where the agent-based model comes into the picture: ABM looks at the people → behaviours → aggregate all the behaviours → look at the outcomes.

Extended Standing Ovation Model has the following implications: 
- Great quality of the show 
- A low threshold for the audience to stand up 
- Large peer effects due to crowd size
- There will be a high variance in tastes, as people will have differing opinions; there will be cinephiles in the audience, those who love analysing and critiquing shows and films
- High-flying celebrities and social media influencers who’ll astonish and delight fans with their appearance and two cents on the matter
- Big groups and dates-similar to the large peer effects, contributing to the crowd size

Elongating the pure coordination game to multiple games, because in every culture there is a lot of different coordination games being played. People have different customs and behaviours in how they meet and greet others, and also how they go about their daily lives, e.g. when entering Asian households, you remove your shoes to not bring dirt into the place. Some cultures bow and curtsy and fold their hands in a prayer to greet others. Jewish people follow a kosher diet, Christians say grace before they eat, and they go church on Sundays. 

Replicator dynamics are a great type of social learning models because they are utilised in 3 disciplinary ways: 
1. Psychology
2. Economics
3. Ecology

### What insights have I gained?
The insights I gained from this week’s content are that Micro-motives does not equal Macro-behaviour. Social Contagion driven by high variance rather than mean behaviour.  According to Boaz (1911), they say: *‘The totality of mental and physical reactions and activities that characterise behavioural responses to environment, others, and to himself/herself. There needs to be some consistency to mental and physical reactions of specific people across the globe.’* The organizational culture looks at the values and behaviours that all go towards the unique social and psychological environment of a business. It’s the way people feel about their work, their beliefs and values, what they think about the company’s future, and how they will contribute towards it getting there. Collectively, these aspects are part of the heart of an organization. As aforementioned, culture can be modelled as a series of pure coordination games, which is pretty insightful as you get to decipher people and why they are the way they are. Culture is a multiple and consistent coordination-there’s so many of us, we are mixed and integrated together.

### What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
For me, my perceived strengths are that I’d like to think I made some progress with my decision making skills, and narrowing down my choices-so that I don’t experience fatigue, and I have my priorities straight. My weakness is I am sill not perfect in them, so I need to keep being intentional with practice.

### What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges I observed this week are that this week and with StuVac coming up, me and my team are working on our Week 8 Pre-Submission assessment. We are doing political election systems, focusing specifically on the US, and what the predicted candidate result would be. As a group, we chose the Rational Actor, Network and Signalling models, as we thought they might be the most suitable models to simulate the election. We discovered that there were a lot of codes and data available online, that need to be harnessed and leveraged. But we discovered that political systems aren’t that simple to model and seek improvements for. We’ll tackle these issues as they come, and using various resources available to us, we can overcome it. 

### What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
What I would do better next time is to create learning sessions where I mix knowledge areas or skills. While learning one thing at a time, even though it is the fastest way to acquire the learning, I found it can, however, put a limit on the extent of the learning. Instead by mixing the knowledge areas in a learning session, can I then sharpen my grasp on all of them better than if I used the session for that one knowledge area alone.

### What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that proved the most useful this week is Fisher’s Theorem, which explains that the rate of adaptation is proportional to that of the variation in that population. This means that people would want a lot of variation in order to learn to adapt faster to the optimal strategy/phenotype/characteristics/etc. This is quite contrary to the six sigma way of thinking which says that more variation is worse because it leads to even more errors. R. A. Fisher is considered to be the founder of modern statistics and at the same time, the starter of population genetics. He was the first to establish the correlation between natural selection and Mendelian genetics. This then paved the way for the neo-Darwinian theory.
